			I joined my highschools robotics club in my Sophomore year. Our school had recently made the 
			transition from VEX and FRC down to FTC for budgeting reasons, and had 2 FTC teams run 
			under one club. It was a very interesting environment to jump into, but there were some 
			problems with the clubs organization and leadership. The vice president, who was my teamâ€™s 
			captain, left the club, leaving my team of 6 new members with no real guidance. Despite this, 
			our team spent a lot of time researching what other teams did and messing around with pieces 
			until we had a robot that was actually ready to compete.

			I was the only person on the team with some computer science knowledge, so I programmed 
			the robot with basic drive functions, and a couple more advanced throttling features and servo 
			controls neither of our teams had ever used before. At our first competition, we actually made it into the quarter finals, and quickly lost to the team that ended up winning the competition. After 
			this experience, my whole team was a lot more confident of our abilities. 
		  </p>

			The following year I became the club president, and I was meant to be a guide for new 
			members while our new advisor handled the logistics. But I felt the success of the club wasn't 
			his responsibility, it was ours, so I became the main point of contact signing up for competitions 
			and buying parts, and emailed, called, and met sponsors for our team. I was passionate about 
			providing the best experience and chance of success for our team, so I was willing to work to 
			make that happen.

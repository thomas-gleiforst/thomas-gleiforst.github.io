			My first Computer Science job was working with MetrospectMedia to remake their website. The 
			owner of the company was a friend of my brother, and he was looking into renaming his 
			company and redoing his website. His previous website had been fairly simple, and was mainly 
			just a hub to other places his content was published. I completely scrapped their old website, 
			reorganized all their content, and rewrote all their information.

			When I was restructuring the site, it was important to me that their videos and pictures were as 
			highlighted as possible. This was a videography company that pretty much did it all, so I wanted 
			to make sure all parts of the company got a spotlight, and work from every section was clear 
			and accessible. More than anything else on the website, I spent the most time adding 
			slideshows and videos to the headers of each page. Since I first began the project, 
			SquareSpace has released updates to make this project simpler, so I have since restructured 
			my implementation to make it more accessible to the client.
		  </p>

			As I was preparing to leave for college, it was clear that I had done enough to build a strong 
			foundation for their website, and left them to continue to make changes to what I had made.

			A lot of the structure is the same, but I the site in its current form certainly is not entirely mine.

			In highschool, I heard a lot about the success of the Mars Rover Design Team (MRDT). When I 
			got to Missouri S&T, the first meeting I went to was an MRDT team meeting. When I first joined 
			the software subteam, I wasnâ€™t sure if I wanted to work on autonomy or basestation, but I picked 
			basestation from my experience with app development. The user interface was a terribly 
			cramped and poorly organized one window application running on a three monitor computer, 
			where the other displays had third party camera and networking software.

			That year we turned the one window application into a three window application, which allowed 
			us to clean up the central window and take control of the networking tools and camera feeds. 
			We had some issues with the intuitiveness of the networking tools and the latency of the camera 
			feeds, but just the ability to free up so much new space to work with was exciting.

			This year the software subteam has split in two, and I am now the Basestation and Signals 
			subteam lead. Currently, my team of about 20 computer science majors are working through a 
			ticket driven development phase, where a bunch of small projects have been split up so we can 
			make incremental changes to as much of the Rover Engagement Display (RED) as possible. In 
			November we will start the next phases, taking a targeted approach working together on the 
			entirety of network manager and then the science attachment view.

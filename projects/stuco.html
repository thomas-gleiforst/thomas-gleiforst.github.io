			I joined student council my freshman year of high school. For a while I was just in it to help 
			coordinate things around the school and because it was fun and my friends were in it. But in my 
			senior year, one of my best friends became the class president. She approached me because 
			every year we had issues tracking members attendance at different events. We had tried 
			scanning ids, but students constantly forgot them, and we tried stamping physical books, but 
			these cost money to print and students constantly lost them. We realized that creating an app to 
			track attendance was the perfect solution; students would always have their phones on them, 
			and if they lost their phones or had to upgrade to a new one, all of their information was 
			collected server side.

			Once we knew that an app was the solution, the debate became how we would actually track 
			attendance. We had to find a solution that would be hard for students to cheat and earn more 
			points than they were supposed to earn, but that was fast so 100+ students could all quickly get 
			their points at the end of a meeting and leave. Since we were worried about projecting some 
			kind of code at the end of meetings in case students took pictures of them and shared them with 
			their friends, we decided the best solution was the advisors would have barcodes that the 
			students would scan at the end of the meeting. Currently, there are 4 different bar codes with 
			different point values so that volunteering to put on an event is worth more points than attending 
			a meeting or bring in snacks.

			This app has been a very good experience to learn about the app distribution process, and to 
			get real experience with helping meet clients need and troubleshoot their issues remotely now 
			that I have moved away.
		  </p>

			The app is currently published as Oakville Student Council on the Google Play Store and Apple 
			App Store.

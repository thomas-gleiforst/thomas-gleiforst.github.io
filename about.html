      <p>
		My name is Thomas Gleiforst and I am a second year CS and CpE student at MST. I always 
		knew that I was interested in Engineering of some sort. In 6th grade I told my teachers I was 
		going to be an electrical engineer, however, it was that summer that I discovered programming. I 
		taught myself how to program using Codecademy and instantly fell in love with it. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I was very involved in high school and graduated 4th in my class. I was the Co-President of the 
		Science Club, the President of the Robotics Club, the President of the Technology Student 
		Association (TSA), the App Developer for the Student Council, and a member of the National 
		Honor Society and Science National Honor Society.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	   I took my clubs very seriously, and dedicated everything I had to their success. I coordinated 
		meetings, met with sponsors, and called businesses asking for donations of everything from 
		food to robotics parts. I always seek out leadership in everything I do, as I feel like I am 
		contributing the most when I am helping other people.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The summers of my highschool experience were filled with exciting camps and competitions. I 
		went to an engineering camp at SIUE where I learned to solder for the first time, a computer 
		science camp at MST where I first explored all the different sides of computer science and got a 
		taste of what life would be like here, a national competition for TSA where I got to compete 
		against a ton of other highschool students, and the National Congress of Future Scientists and 
		Technologists where I was immersed in an arena full of like minded individuals and attended 
		presentations from speakers at the forefront of innovation.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The computer science classes in my highschool were limited, so I was very excited about going 
		into college to be able to jump into a formal computer science education. As soon as I got here I 
		joined the Mars Rover Design Team and the Association of Computing and Machinery's 
		Competition Special Interest Group (ACM SIG-Comp). Going into this year I became the 
		Basestation and Signals Team Lead for Mars Rover and the Eventsmaster for ACM-COMP, and 
		I am looking forward to what I can do to improve these organizations
	  </p>
	  <p>
		In Fall of 2018, I applied to the NSF SStem Scholarship at my school. Starting Spring of 2019, 
		I have been a part of this amazing cohort of scholars. We are the first group of SStem Scholars, 
		so the program is still being ironed out, but I am looking forward to contributing to the PERCEPOLIS 
		research project and getting to work with this group of smart students and knowledgeable advisors.

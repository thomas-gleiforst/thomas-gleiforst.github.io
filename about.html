	    My name is Thomas Gleiforst. I am a student in my second year of college at Missouri S&T. I took a lot
		of AP courses and dual credit (as well as did dual enrollment) in highschool, so I transfered in a year
		and a half worth of credits. Because of this, I am hoping to graduate with my Bachelor's in Computer
		Science and Computer Engineering in May of 2021.

	    I always knew that I was interested in Engineering of some sort. In 6th grade, entering middle school,
		I told my teachers I was going to be an electrical engineer, and I am proud that I was pretty spot on.
		However, it was that summer that I discovered programming. I taught myself how to program using
		Codecademy and instantly fell in love with it. My freshman year of highschool I joined the Science
		Club and the Student Council. By the next year I was the co-president of the Science Club and decided
		to try out our schools robotics club. We had two FIRST FTC teams, and a lot of new members. The vice
		president of the club was my team captain, and he dropped the club early in the year, leaving me and 4
		other new members to figure everything out ourselves. I took up the role of team captain, and while our
		team didn't do great that year, I was definitely proud of our performace and turn around. I became the 
		president of the club for the next two years. My junior year I joined the Technology Student Association,
		which was brand new that year. We jumped into the club halway through the year, which was a bit chaotic,
		which put my team very behind on the prepared tasks. However, at the state competition I participated solo
		in the coding competition (which was primarily groups of 2-3 programmers), and took 2nd place in state.
		The following year I became the president of that club, helping put on the first St. Louis regional 
		competition, where I teamed up with a good friend of mine and we placed 1st in the region and the continued
		to place 2nd in the state. That summer I attended the national conference in Atlanta, Georgia. My team mate
		got sick right before the competition, so I had to compete alone. While I did not place at that competition,
		it was still an amazing experience. Jumping back into the summer between my Junior and Senior year, it was
		at this time I joined National Honor Society and National Science Honors Society, and was approached by
		the Student Council president to develop and application for the school that would track member attendance.
		That summer I developed an application for the Student Council using OutSystems, and it remains in use by
		the school, published on both android and apple app stores.

		The computer science classes in my highschool were limited, so I was very excited going into college to be
		able to jump into a formal computer science education. As soon as I got here I joined the Mars Rover Design
		Team and the Association of Computing and Machinery's Competition Special Interest Group (ACM SIG-Comp). 
		I had heard a lot about the successes of the Mars Rover Design team in highschool, so I was excited to be a
		part of the team. I spent my first year working as a member of the Basestation subteam. I worked on UX 
		optimizations and general software development for the Rover Engagment Display (RED) that controls the rover. 
		While I didn't get to go to the competition, it was amazing knowing I contributed to this project. We placed 
		5th place this summer (out of 36 teams) in the University Rover Challenge. Going into this year I became the 
		Basestation and Signals Team Lead, and I am looking forward to what I can do to move the team even further along.

		I knew I would like ACM SIG-Comp from my experience with programming competitions in highschool, and I was definitely
		correct. I wasn't able to participate in ICPC (the regional programming competition my school attends) this year,
		so my first semester in this club was mainly going to meetings which were lecture style discussions with a professor
		about specific coding techniques and operations that don't get much coverage in normal classes that would help
		us prepare better in competitions. However, at semester change our teacher had some conflicts and was unable to mentor
		us this last semester. I helped our president decide to shift towards having bi-weekly competitions as practice,
		and then we would review the problems that people struggled with and the techniques we took the following week.
		This was a success, and really made the club something enjoyable that started to bring in a slightly different 
		croud of programmers that were looking for a fun time. At the end of the semester I became the Eventsmaster,
		so I am in charge of coordinating our events and competitions this semester, and I hope to bring a lot more members
		into this newer phase of our club.

		In Fall of 2018, I applied to the NSF SStem Scholarship at my school. Starting Spring of 2019, I have been a part of this 
		amazing cohort of scholars. We are the first group of SStem Scholars, so the program is still being ironed out,
		but I am looking forward to contributing to the PERCEPOLIS research project and getting to work with this group
		of smart students and knowledgable advisors.
